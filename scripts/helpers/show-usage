  ---
  Creates a Kubernetes cluster on the desktop using VirtualBox and kickstart for hands-free CentOS
  or Rocky Linux installation. The cluster consists of three nodes: one controller and two workers.
  The nodes are configured with networking support for host-to-guest, guest-to-guest, and
  guest-to-internet.

  The script creates a "template" VM, and then clones that for each cluster node. The initial
  template VM creation runs Kickstart to install the OS, and also installs VirtualBox Guest Additions
  because that provides the ability to get the IP address from a running VM. Note - creating the template
  VM takes a fair bit of time, including the initial 60 seconds for the boot menu to time out and actually
  start the install.

  Usage: dtk [--vboxdir=</some/path>] [--host-network-interface=<interface>] [--host-only-network=<network>] 
             [--networking=<type>] [--monitoring=<type>] [--create-template] [--template-name] [--single-node]
             [--linux=<centos8/9|rocky|alma>] [--storage=<type>] [--containerized-cplane=<list>]
             [--verify=<files|upstreams>] [--check-compatibility] [--up=<nodelist>] [--down=<nodelist>]
             [--delete=<nodelist>] [--help]

  Options:

    Cluster creation options:

    --vboxdir                  Required. The directory where you keep your VirtualBox VM files. The directory must
                               exist. The script will not create it.
    --host-network-interface   Specify this, or --host-only-network. If this, then the value is the name of the primary
                               network interface on your machine. The scripts use this to configure the VirtualBox
                               bridge network for each node VM. This option must be applied identically to the
                               template VM and all clones.
    --host-only-network        Specify this, or --host-network-interface. If this, then the value is the left three
                               octets of the host only network. This option configures NAT + host only networking
                               mode. The scripts will create a new host only network and configure the cluster to
                               use it for intra-cluster networking, and will configure NAT for the cluster to
                               access the internet. This option must be applied identically to the template VM
                               and all clones.
    --networking               Installs k8s networking. Current valid values are "calico", and "cilium". E.g.:
                               --networking=calico. (Calico also installs kube-proxy.)
    --monitoring               Optional. Installs monitoring. Allowed values are "metrics.k8s.io", and
                               "kube-prometheus".
    --create-template          Optional. First creates a template VM from which to clone all the cluster nodes.
                               (This step by far takes the longest.) You have to do this at least once. Once the
                               template is created, brings up the cluster by cloning the template for each node.
                               If not specified, the script expects to find an existing VM to clone from.
    --template-name            Optional. Specifies the template name to create - or clone from. Default is
                               "bingo" if not provided.
    --single-node              Optional. Creates a single node cluster. The default is to create one control
                               plane node, and two workers. This option is useful to quickly test changes since
                               it is faster to provision a single node.
    --linux                    Optional. Valid values are "centos8/9" for CentOS Stream (default is 8), "alma" for
                               Alma Linux,  and "rocky" for Rocky Linux. Ignored unless --create-template is provided.
    --storage                  Optional. Installs a dynamic storage provisioner. This supports testing workloads
                               that use PVs and PVCs. Presently, the only supported value is "openebs". E.g.:
                               --storage=openebs
    --containerized-cplane     Optional. If specified, creates the control plane components as static pods on the
                               controller VM like Kubeadm, RKE2, et. al. (By default, creates the control plane
                               components as as systemd units.) Allowed values: "all", or any of comma-separated:
                               "etcd", "kube-apiserver", "kube-proxy", "kube-scheduler", "kube-controller-manager".
                               E.g.: "--containerized-cplane=etcd,kube-proxy"

    Other optional options:

    --verify                   Looks for all the upstreams or filesystem objects used by the script. Valid options
                               are "upstreams" and "files". If "upstreams", then the script does a curl HEAD request
                               for each upstream (e.g. OS ISO, Kubernetes binaries, etc.). If "files", then
                               the same check is performed for the downloaded filesystem objects. This is a useful
                               option to see all the objects that are required to provision a cluster.
    --check-compatibility      Checks the installed versions of various utils used by the project (curl, kubectl,
                               etc) against what the project has been tested on - and then exits, taking no
                               further action. You should do this at least once.
    --up                       Takes a comma-separated list of VM names, and starts them all.
    --down                     Opposite of --up. Note - this is very low-tech at present: Order the args with the
                               workers first and the controller last.
    --delete                   Tears down the cluster: Force stops all VMs and removes associated files from
                               the directory specified in the --vboxdir option.
    --help                     Displays this help and exits.

  Examples:

    dtk --create-template --host-network-interface=enp0s31f6 --vboxdir=/sdb1/virtualboxvms --networking=calico

    Wires the VirtualBox bridge network to interface "enp0s31f6", uses the "/sdb1/virtualboxvms" directory
    for all VM files. Creates a template to clone the nodes from. Installs calico networking

    dtk --host-only-network=192.168.56 --vboxdir=/sdb1/virtualboxvms --single-node --networking=calico

    Uses an existing template VM. Configures host-only plus NAT networking. Creates a single-node cluster.

    dtk --up=vm1,vm2,vm3

    Starts the VMs for the default three-node cluster created by the script.'
