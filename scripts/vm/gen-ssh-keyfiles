# Looks in <project root>/generated/kickstart for id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub. If both exist, does
# nothing. Otherwise generates id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub in that directory. These get included in the
# kickstart ISO that is generated by the 'gen-kickstart-iso' script. Since the public key is wired into the
# template VM, the private key can be used to SSH into *any* VM cloned from the template. So the only
# time to re-gen this key pair is when creating a new template VM if they don't already exist. If you don't
# like the key pair just delete the files before you regen the template. (Any other VMs created/cloned
# from prior key pair values obviously need the new public key added to the VM's authorized_keys file.)
